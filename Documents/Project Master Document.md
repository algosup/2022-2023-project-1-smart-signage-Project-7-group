# Project Master Document
## Project Genesis
The Following Project has been brought to us by Franck Jeannin, Director of Algosup, and by the whole Algosup crew as our first project of the year.

We were given a brief overview of the challenges SignAll were facing and we have been indicated that long range hardware radios could potentially help face the issues SignAll and its customers are facing and might face in the future.

After validating our initial research, provisional insights and solutions, we were given the chance to visit SignAll's factory in Les Forges, Vierzon.

This allowed us to learn more, not only about all aspects of SignAll's domain, but also to meet the most involved in the processes and products we are trying to tackle with our creativity, which helps.

This project was conducted with great interest from all team Members as it is always a pleasure to contribute to local and tangible economy and activity.

It goes without saying that the idea of helping such an actor to render their activities more ecological, efficient and progressive, while helping such actor an actor maintain its position in the market is at the same time a great honor and a pleasure.

## General Methodology
Our Methodology was to use to double diamond design process.

This Framework/Philosophy consists of two phases : Research Phase and Design Phase.
- In the first phase we initialized our work by following the main guidelines given by our school representative, Franck Jeannin.
- We then started imagining the product and solving the technical challenges of using predefined technologies while slowly maturing our ideas.
- Only then, did we meet the customer, after a 3 week mark to have the final solution developed the remaining 2 weeks when we had the opportunity to understand the clients needs completely.
- This process results in our solution as well as three documents that are in continuation to one another : The Business Analysis Document (Research Phase), followed by the Functional Requirements Document (Research and Design Phases) and finally the Technical Requirements Document (Design Phase).
- This allows stakeholders to understand our reasoning in a broad and thorough manner and to be as extensive and transparent as possible.

We also used our own adapted Scrum Methodology along with a Retroplanning (Gantt Diagram) to manage our time better as well as a Kanban for tracking our smaller tasks and identifying bottlenecks.

Finally, we ensured a strict Quality Assurance methodology to deliver the most reliable product that matches exactly the specification enunciated both in the Functional and Technical Requirements Documents.

Overall, we stayed within our defined roles but as the deadlines approached, we felt the need to complete and verify each other's work to wrap up the project.

## Quality Assurance Methodology
Our group features a quality assurance engineer whose mission is as follows:
The role of the quality engineer is to monitor, inspect and propose measures to correct or improve the project's final products in order to meet established quality standards.

In Order to ensure meeting quality requirements we had to define what we wanted to test. We figured out there were Exploratory, Functional, Performance and Security testing.
- The Exploratory testing was about testing anything that would come to our mind intuitively.
- Functional testing was about the features that needed to work on our product and making sure they met the requirements.
- Performance testing, which in our timespan was not really feasible, are supposed to measure how fast a product performs and identifies potential bottlenecks.
- Finally, Security testing allowed us to ensure rudimentary security measures, following ANSSI 's 4 main guidelines:
	- Availability
	- Integrity
	- Confidentiality/Privacy
	- Traceability

After analyzing the product and the target audience, we came up with a testing strategy and testing objectives.

Each test had its own pre-conditions, suspension criteria and exit criteria.

Overall, we tried as much to integrate quality engineering
