# Functional Requirements Document
## Introduction
### Purpose
The purpose of the functional requirements document (FRD) is to present the stakeholders with the needs and requirements for the implementation of remotely controlled and monitored smart signage completely, accurately and unambiguously in a technology-independent manner. This information is captured and written by the Program Management of our group during the analysis phase.

The FRD is the primary input to the design and development phases, and is the primary specification for User Acceptance. The document is intended to be read by all responsible for the management of the project development initiative including business users, user representatives and sponsors, and other interested parties.

Finally, the functional requirements contribute to splitting our work with SignAll into multiple domains. Having the functional domain separated from the technical one, allows us to tailor, debug and develop the solution faster to tackle either business analysis, functional analysis or technical development problems distinctively.

### Scope
The following functional requirements will present you the solution, described by its functions. As an overview of what will be talked about we will defined what is in and out of our scope.

###  In Scope
- V0 of the solution
- Local/Remote Monitoring via Webhooks (web interface)
- Creation of a LoRa Protocol for Electronic Signage
- Auto-dimming depending on ambient brightness and/or schedule curve
- Dimming/Activation Scheduling via interface
- LED/Circuit Fault Detection and reporting

### Out of Scope
Due to time and resources constraints, some functionalities have not been implemented yet, including, but not limited to:
- End User App (a first glance will be showed nonetheless, since it displays other functionalities included in our V0
- SignAll master backend
- Adding other functions to the device to replace other in-situ electronics (like Yaki)
- Predictive Maintenance (lacking data on how to predict LED failure, however it may be possible to do so with more data)

### Background
Our solution was tailored with regards to the SignAll's business logic, their existing activities, the needs of their customers, the new regulations regarding LED signs, climate consciousness evolving and finally SignAll's executive team's own observations and desires.

The solution we crafted is expandable for future improvements and considerations, but with the time given, we had to prioritize the functions we listed to focus on its development on a relatively short time.

The following work will serve as a basis to a future relationship with SignAll, as we have understood that their vision goes far beyond the realm of connected signage.

## Functional Requirements
### Assumptions
- LoRa is robust and will last
- LoRa is the appropriate technology to answer SignAll and its customer's needs.
- Electric signage will last
	- Legally speaking (see recent regulations)
	- Environmentally speaking (for brand image and energy consumption)
- Signall has the will to adapt, scale and install all the devices
- That SignAll has the means to support development
- The ability to discuss further with all stakeholders and actors of the sytem for continuous developement
- Approval of the system by all stakeholders
- Ability to plug an encased device on existing signs sometimes exposed directly to the exterior
- LoRa gateways must be in reasonable range from the devices

### Constraints
- Retrofitting: cannot be plugged on signs that function with older non-LED technologies, for example.
- Needs to be cheap : easy to install / maintain to satisfy customers' needs and be worth it
- Parts must be widely available
- We only have one developer (as of now)
- LoRa infrastructure is scarce in the region
- Product opens up a theoretical cyber attack surface
- We met the client late, therefore, will not be able to produce non-essential functions for the solution at V0 delivery time (Friday, 28th October).
- While SignAll wanted business opportunities and research matter rather than a fully functional product, our school will judge the technical feasibility of the project rather than the insight it may or may not bring to the SignAll.

### B - Reliability
There are mainly two points to take into consideration:
- The potential failures of the hardware components:
	- Due to environmental conditions:
		- With waterproof casing (e.g.: from SignAll's manufacturing chain) most environmental hazards can be mitigated, apart from extreme events such as thunder storms, tornados (flying projectiles that can damage the circuits and the outer shell), which don't occur in France and finally floods, that could potentially harm the outlet connection if the water ever reaches high levels.
	- Due to Electronic failure:
		- As mentioned earlier on the hardware used is known to be reliable durable, but failures may occur in the span of 5 years to a decade, which would require assessment and intervention and potentially replacement of a component.

- The potential failure of the LoRa Network:
	- If the Things Network is saturated, it can be difficult/impossible for the communication to be established with the hardware
	- During a thunderstorm, radio networks can be incapacitated due to electromagnetic interference

## C - Maintainability
Apart from failures, the product does not require any specific maintenance, unless a major upgrade to the firmware needs to be applied to support new functions.

## D - Scalability
As mentioned earlier on, the product uses a highly resilient network that can scale up from 10 to 1000 units for a one size-fits all price. However, if need be, other more reliable networks can be leveraged to pursue scaling. Typically, The Things Network provide a sufficient basis for beginning.

However, once reaching a bigger scale (few hundreds of devices) using a corporate network as Bouygues TelecomÂ® (Objenious) or OrangeÂ® (Orange LoRaÂ®)

It is also important to note that scaling the deployment of the solution will greatly improve the cost of the hardware, since a custom PCB can be designed removing the useless components in our "Development Setup", which is estimated to lower the prices to approximately 30 euros per board for an order of 1000boards, for instance.

## E - Availability
If Plugged to a power outlet and no massive electromagnetic interference is happening, the circuit should be available at all times.

In the event of a power failure, an optional battery module should in substance maintain the board active for 5-10 years depending on the length of the outage and on the power consumption of the board.

## F - Security
Following the ANSSI's guidelines, we ensured that our product followed the DICP criteria. (AIPT)
- Availability: By using highly reliable and resilient long range radio low power networks, we ensure the availability of the devices at any time, anywhere (with an internet connection and as long as the required gateways are present)
- Integrity: By enforcing authentication through the Things Network we can ensure that no unauthorized individual can bring modifications to the system, therefore preserving its integrity. Optionally privilege groups can be set among end users of the solution to restrict higher level functions to more privileged actors.
- Confidentiality/Privacy: The LoRaWAN network is one of the few networks to provide end-to-end encryption  by default using military grade AES encryption for encrypting payloads. In terms of physical security, tamper-evident storage technology may be used to make physical access evident and even monitored through the journaling system to backtrack potential unauthorized changes.
- Traceability: we use a logging system that provides the solution with extensive monitoring capabilities, therefore allowing for easy and predictive maintenance and security.

## G - Transition requirements
The Solution has been thought to accommodate existing signs and new ones, given the 12v adapters we were provided for the prototype. The solution is also fitted for 220v applications as well.

Most of the maintenance and installation tasks can be undertaken by existing sign technicians with basic tools and a small training on the topic.

We have noticed that SignAll already has the capacity to create appropriate shielding to accommodate the circuits to protect them from environmental issues. We anticipate that some adjustments will be needed to the manufacturing process of the casings to ensure the board's protection.

## Conclusion

To conclude this functional overview of our value proposition, we would like to add share some of the ideas we had in mind, for which we paved the way but still excluded from our V.0 due to lack of time and resource, but that we would still like to develop, given more time.
- SignAll's backend to monitor all the products
- Add Expandability to its functionality like yaki products but all in one.
- Open data weather adaptive brightness
- Predictive Maintenance (lacking technical on LED lifecycles and behaviour)
- Motion sensor in combination with adaptive brightness to reduce energy consumption
